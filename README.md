The goal of this program is to utilize an autoencoder neural network to compress and reconstruct images from the MNIST dataset. The autoencoder consists of an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder compresses the input image into a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original image from this compressed representation.

The program begins by defining the architecture of the autoencoder. The encoder uses a Dense layer with 64 neurons and the ReLU activation function to compress the input image into a 64-dimensional representation. The decoder uses a Dense layer with 784 neurons and the sigmoid activation function to reconstruct the original image from the compressed representation.

The program then loads the MNIST dataset and preprocesses the data by normalizing the pixel values to be between 0 and 1 and reshaping the images into a one-dimensional array.

The autoencoder is then trained on the training data using the Adam optimizer and the binary cross-entropy loss function. The program uses a batch size of 256 and trains for 50 epochs.

After training, the program uses the encoder to compress the test images into a lower-dimensional representation and the decoder to reconstruct the original images from this compressed representation. The program then displays the original and reconstructed images side-by-side for the first 10 test images.

The results show that the autoencoder is able to successfully compress and reconstruct the test images. The reconstructed images are not perfect, but they are still recognizable as the original images. This demonstrates the potential of autoencoders for image compression and reconstruction.
